# 👋 Hey there, welcome to my 20225 ver. portfolio website

## What's this all about?

This is my 2025 portfolio showcasing some of my favorite UIUX and more design projects and experiments. Think of it as my little corner of the internet where I get to show off what I've been building! Check the work here: [WEBSITE:)](https://ruocanpeng.com/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Cool Stuff**: Interactive components that might make you go "whoa!"
- **Pretty Things**: Designs that don't hurt your eyes (I promise)
- **Clever Code**: Some React magic happening behind the scenes
- **Easter Eggs**: Maybe... you'll have to explore to find out!

## 🛠️ Built With

This site was crafted with:
- React (because who doesn't love components?)
- Plenty of late-night coding sessions
- Probably too much coffee

## 👀 Taking a peek?

If you're checking out the code:
1. Yes, I know that function could be more efficient
2. I was really proud of that clever solution in the navbar
3. Comments are there for future-me who will definitely forget what past-me was thinking
